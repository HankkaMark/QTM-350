For example, 10 year US treasuries. For simplicity, you may assume that this interest rate is the same as the rate `r` on mortgages. In reality it is lower, but they are strongly correlated.\n",

For example, they may be attempting *interest rate arbitrage*, where one invests whatever cash they have in investments which they hope will have a higher rate of return over the liftime of the home loan than the interest rate `rate` on the home loan. Or, they simply may not have the cash to spend. \n",
        "Typically, to avoid additional fees, it is necessary to make a down payment of 20% of the purchase price of the home, while the minimum down payment allowed is 5%. The loan term is most often 30 years, meaning the amount borrowed is paid back in full over 30 years, although 15 and 10 are also used by some buyers to minimize the amount paid in interest. Since the renter profile is taking borrowing to the extremes, we will assume they use a 30 year loan term.\n",
